This program is public domain. Feel free to modify it, hack it, use 
it inside other programs. I wrote it to better understand raytracing
and hope that it helps others understand the raytracing process as well.

Should you significantly extend my program, through bug fixes or additional
features, send the changes back to me for inclusion in later versions
of the program.
