To install the `rtrace' raytracer is quite simple:

1.	Look at config.h to check whether your computer understands void
	and other things.

2.	Check the Makefile.

3.	Type 'make' or 'make fast'. It should compile. To install type
	'make install'.

4.	To test, try running it on the "logo.sff" file. This file can be
	created from the SFF document file (or man file).

		rtrace [OPTIONS] logo.sff logo.pic >&logo.log

	where [OPTIONS] can be: w400 p0 s8 S0.001

5.	To display the image, you need to hack a filter to change it into
	a format your display device can understand.  The format is simple
	and described in the README.
